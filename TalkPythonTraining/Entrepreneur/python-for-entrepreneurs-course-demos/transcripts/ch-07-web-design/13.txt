 0:02 So it's time to talk about layout, 
0:05 and layout works in conjunction with the box model,
0:08 to basically determine how things look on the screen where they get placed, 
0:12 when there is new line wraps and so on. 
0:14 If you understand a few things about css like the layout, 
0:17 the box model and the selectors, you are like 80% of the way there. 
0:22 So, let's take a pretty cool example here, here we have a list of items, 
0:25 they are actually hyper links that go to the various parts of our pages, 
0:29 home, css selectors, css box model layout and float items, 
0:33 so these should be pretty familiar to you by now, 
0:36 that's just the little list that's on the home screen but notice this is on /layout,
0:40 there is no extra stuff, it's really just this little bit on the screen. 
0:43 So we are going to do just a little bit of css and tweak with the layout 
0:46 to turn this into a full on navigational menu. 
0:50 Now, just to be clear, this navigational menu is probably not 
0:54 what you wanted to do for real navigation, 
0:57 we are going to get to bootstrap and responsive design 
1:00 and drop down menus and all sorts of cool stuff, 
1:02 but this is more just to show you like look how dramatically we can change 
1:05 the layout and the appearance of a numbered list more or less, 
1:10 so this is going to be really cool and it won't take much effort at all so let's go do this.
