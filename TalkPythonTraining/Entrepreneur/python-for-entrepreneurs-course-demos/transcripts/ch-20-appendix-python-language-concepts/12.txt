 0:01 Packages and modules must be imported in Python before they can be used. 
0:06 It doesn't matter if it's in external package of the package index, 
0:09 in module from the standard library or even a module or package
0:12 you yourself have created, you have to import it. 
0:16 So code as it's written right here likely will not work, 
0:20 you will get some kind of name error os doesn't exist, path doesn't exist. 
0:23 That's because the os module and the path method contained within it 
0:28 have not been imported. 
0:30 So we have to write one of two statements above, 
0:33 don't write them both, one or the other. 
0:35 So, the top one lets us import the module and retains the name space, 
0:39 so that we can write style one below, so here we would say os.path.exist 
0:44 so you know that the path method is coming out of the os module. 
0:47 Alternatively, if you don't want to continue repeat os.this, os.that, 
0:52 and you just want to say path, you can do that by saying this other style 
0:57 from os import path. 
0:59 And then you don't have to use the name space, 
1:01 you might do this for method used very commonly
1:03 whereas you might use style one for methods that are less frequently used. 
1:07 Now, there is the third style here, where we could write from os import star, 
1:10 that means just like the line above, where we are importing path, 
1:14 but in fact, import everything in the os module. 
1:17 You are strongly advised to stay away from this format 
1:20 unless you really know what you are doing, this style will import and replace 
1:24 anything in your current name space that happens to come out of the os. 
1:28 So for example, if you had some function that was called register, 
1:33 and maybe there is a register method inside os module, 
1:37 this import might erase your implementation depending where it comes from. 
1:41 So, modules must be imported before you use them, 
1:44 I would say prefer to use the name space style it's more explicit 
1:48 on where path actually comes from, 
1:51 you are certain that this is the path from the os module, 
1:54 not a different method that you wrote somewhere else 
1:56 and it just happens to have the same name. 
1:58 Style two also works well, style three- not so much.
