 0:01 In order to use Bower, you have to install it.
0:03 And the way you get it installed is with npm, so you just npm install - g for global, 
0:09 rather than local one, bower. 
0:12 So here you can see it says it requires node, npm and git. 
0:18 I've already installed bower, so I don't need to do that 
0:21 but you should follow these directions using node and npm, 
0:24 once you get them set up we are going to work with installing our dependencies. 
0:28 so over here, we have our web application, and you can see our code, 
0:34 this is our top level for a website, here is the egg info from setup.py develop 
0:40 and here is the actual logic of our application, 
0:44 in the static folder is where we would like to put things 
0:47 like javascript, css, images and so on, 
0:49 so that seems like the right place for bower to manage its dependencies 
0:53 which largely consists of those things. 
0:56 So let's go over here, we can see that I am actually in that folder, in the static folder 
1:01 and let's say bower list, see if anything is here, nope, there is nothing here, 
1:06 and notice, there is no bower components folder here, 
1:10 so you know there is actually nothing going on with bower. 
1:12 One of the things we want to replace we saw the dependency on bootstrap 
1:16 and we would like to replace that so why don't we install that? 
1:19 Your first inclination would be to do this. 
1:23 And it's fine, you can totally bower install bootstrap, 
1:26 but you are going to get all of the assets 
1:28 and things basically clone the entire bootstrap repo in github 
1:33 so you have all the building blocks, 
1:35 not just the stuff you want to ship for your after work, 
1:38 so there is a shorter version you can use, so if you say -css, 
1:42 it just brings kind of non intuitive, it brings a css javascript and fonts 
1:47 but basically the distribution folder for bootstrap. 
1:51 So I've already installed this, it doesn't need to download it, 
1:53 you can see it's taking this straightfrom github, it's validated it and it's installed it. 
1:58 Now if we go back here, you can see we have bower components, bootstrap css, 
2:02 little bower project file we've got the css that we need, minified non minified, 
2:06 we've got the fonts and we've got the javascript, again minified and non minified. 
2:12 What's so different about this? 
2:14 Well, one we have it offline, we could have just gone 
2:16 and downloaded bootstrap and dropped it in here, unzipped it, 
2:18 but then we couldn't upgrade it, we couldn't manage it, 
2:21 so for example I can come over here and say bower update, 
2:25 and if there was a new version of bootstrap, 
2:29 it would have actually upgraded it for us so that's really cool. 
2:31 I don't do that for all of our dependencies, 
2:34 We probably want jquery, so let's go and install that, 
2:37 move this over so you can see them coming in, 
2:40 so we have bower we have jquery, we saw respond js we also saw html5 shiv 
2:47 let's put those in, so now we have those as well. 
2:52 Another one that I think is great is font awesome. 
2:55 Font awesome is really good for little widgets and icons in your site, 
2:59 that are not actually images but are fonts 
3:02 so you can color them and resize them perfectly, 
3:05 so let's put that in there as well. Beautiful. 
3:09 Now, all of our components are setup here, 
3:11 so font awesome for example there are our fonts. 
3:15 And the last thing to do is go to our template and start using these 
3:18 instead of the ones that are coming off the cdn. 
3:22 Notice over here how this refreshed, let's go and find our bootstrap css here 
3:27 copy the path, and let's update this. 
3:33 Now you don't want the whole path of course, 
3:37 you just want from static down because this is sort of the folder 
3:40 containing our app this down is our app
3:44 so let's just go back here and cut this off, like so,
3:46 so now we have our bootstrap. 
3:48 Now, there is one little detail about this possibly getting cashed and if we update it, 
3:53 that could be a problem, it rarely is for bootstrap, it much more likely is for our site. 
3:58 Let's do the same for html5 shive and respond js. 
4:05 Great, so that should take care of things for the css 
4:08 and now we just have to do the javascript. 
4:12 I have no intention of debugging these so let's just keep using the min versions. 
4:16 All right, let's run the site, it better still look the same. 
4:20 Oh, how interesting, this is worth pointing out, 
4:22 so when you create one of these projects in PyCharm, 
4:25 notice there is two blue yellow apps running here, 
4:28 this one has little green dot that means it's still running, 
4:31 this is one I tried to run, it crash so it exited sadly with code 1, that makes it sad, 
4:35 so what happened, well, these web apps of course they [...] on a port
4:40 but you can only have one app or process bound to that port, 
4:44 well, how do we solve that, we just go to PyCharm and say PyCharm don't do that, 
4:48 say I would like a single instance only 
4:51 so that way when you say I want to run or rerun this app, 
4:54 it will shut down the old one meaning there should be no problem running it. 
4:58 Here notice I wasn't using my virtual environment so let's set that back as well. 
5:03 Notice how it asks do you want to rerun this, 
5:06 just say never ever show me that again, 
5:09 and it will automatically rerun it for us every time. 
5:12 Wonderful, so it's up and running on local host, let's have a look, 
5:15 see everything is still working. 
5:18 Well that sure looks like bootstrap, let's have a quick look; 
5:23 so here you can see our bootstrap, if I click on this great, we have Twitter bootstrap. 
5:28 And what else were we looking for, response js but of course, 
5:31 these are only brought in for IE8, I really hope no one is using IE8, 
5:35 all right let's check this out, one more time, jquery, ok, good, jquery is good, 
5:39 and the bootstrap js perfect, 
5:42 so it looks like we've successfully moved to bower 
5:47 managing our various dependencies, bootstrap distribution, 
5:51 font awesome, html5 shiv and respond for old school IE support, and jquery. 
5:57 Finally, if you ever wonder well, what is installed here,
6:00 what versions and so on, you can easily ask bower. 
6:04 Say list and it will tell you if there is an upgrade or anything like that, 
6:07 for our purposes we can ignore extraneous, this thing sort of manages this 
6:13 as if we are building a bower package ourself 
6:15 and then these are the dependencies and then what it's saying is
6:18 you are not using this in your current package, no no, we are not using that way, 
6:21  we are just simply installing them into our web app. 
6:23 If we wanted to set up a file with these dependencies
6:26 so we could regenerate them just from our bower.json we could, 
6:29 but I don't really see a huge benefit to that.
