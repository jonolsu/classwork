 00:03 We've seen that we can use view models 
00:08 to add very nice and elegant server side validation. 
00:11 Now, if I come over here I can click this and you'll see it in action. 
00:15 Notice, in the background it's saying hey you called the server for a post 
00:18 but it didn't let us register, you must specify a password. 
00:22 Ok, I'll put something nice, now it says they don't match, 
00:25 now I'll try it again, and so on. 
00:28 So it says you must specify an email address but notice if I put just kj 
00:32 it thinks that's great because we didn't actually validate 
00:35 that it was a proper email address, we probably should do that. 
00:39 however, let's go back over here and see if we can take 
00:42 a little bit of the load off the server and make it a little nicer experience for our users, 
00:47 let's add client side validation using html 5, this is super easy folks, 
00:51 so all of these fields, are going to be required, and in html 5 in modern browsers, 
00:57 we can say that they are required by adding the required attribute. 
01:01 Literally, this is all we have to do. Like this. 
01:04 Now, if I come over here and I reload, reload the html and I hit go, 
01:09 notice all the required ones turn red and fill out 
01:12 and if I bring up the server here again, as I click this, 
01:16 notice, there is no going to the server, this is purely client side 
01:20 so I can put a, b and notice as I interact with it , the red goes away. 
01:24 How nice, huh? 
01:27 The other thing we want to do is we want to validate 
01:30 that this is not just required up here, but is an email, 
01:33 so in html 5 we have a few new types, one of them being email. 
01:38 So if I refresh this again, I can come over here and I can put the, the, if I say go, 
01:45 well it looks like 1password thinks I am creating account, 
01:48 that's not what I am up to, go away. 
01:50 Here I've disabled 1password. 
01:53 So if we have some kind of password here 
01:55 and say go and it says you have to fill out this field, 
01:57 also this one notice it got good if I just put something like the I register, 
02:01 It says no no you must enter an email address not just some text, 
02:04 how cool is that, and I'll say the@the.com 
02:08 notice, apparently that is still valid, because maybe it's an internal domain, 
02:13 but at least it does a little bit of validation, 
02:15 here we go, put something like that, now if it works, 
02:18 this is going to go all the way the server 
02:20 and the server actually did further validation set 
02:23 what you typed here did not match what you typed there, ok, 
02:26 this should let us through, cool, 
02:28 now notice this actually looks different in different browsers
02:30 so here this is Firefox and you saw how this was represented, 
02:34 now notice if I do the same thing over here in Chrome, 
02:38 refresh this, and I try to register, it says please fill out this field 
02:42 and I put the it says please include an @ in the email address the is missing the @
02:48 and so each one has a slightly different way of working with those 
02:51 so we'll say the @ the.com a, b, c 
02:55 so now of course if I type in the passwords correctly it will let us in. 
02:59 So you can see with a little bit of required and a little bit of type  equals email,
03:04 everything is good, you might wonder 
03:06 hey should I just skip this whole service side validation thing 
03:10 and put it all in here in a Javascript or html 5? 
03:13 No, it's super easy to take these things and just http post them to the server, 
03:18 as some sort of app or something like requests, 
03:21 and entirely skip the whole client side validation 
03:23 so you are going to need the server side validation too, 
03:26 but you will probably give your users a slightly nicer experience 
03:29 with the little sprinkling of html 5 validation.
