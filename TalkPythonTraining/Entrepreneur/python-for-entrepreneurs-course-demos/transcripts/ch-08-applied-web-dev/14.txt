00:01 Let's take a moment and talk about the options we have
00:04 for templates and template languages. 
00:07 So three of the most popular template languages for Python are 
00:11 Ginger 2, Mako and Chameleon. 
00:15 As you've seen, Chameleon is default template language in Pyramid
00:20 but it's not the only option, if you prefer Ginger 2, 
00:23 then wherever you see the include 
00:26 and the requirement specification for Pyramid_Chameleon 
00:29 just change that to Pyramid_Ginger 2 
00:32 similarly, if you like Mako, go for that. 
00:35 In this section we are going to focus on two things, 
00:38 we are going to focus on how to use template to define data driven html pages, 
00:43 and how to use Chameleon to build a shared single definition of the site design. 
00:50 So, how do we build one view that basically defines the master view 
00:55 for all the pages and then each individual page just adds its own special content, 
01:00 whatever it is about that page that is unlike all the others.
