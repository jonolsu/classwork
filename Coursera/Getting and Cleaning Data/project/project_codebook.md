Data Set Information for aggtidydata.txt:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Data captured represents measurements Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope.

This data is stored in wide tidy format.  Each variable measured is in one column, and each observation is in a different row.  The format of the file is space delimited.

By column:

1	groupedavg_subjectgrouped.	This represents the subject (human).  This ranges from 1 to 30 representing 30 different people
2	groupedavg_activitygroupe.	This represents the activity, of which there are six: LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS.
3-79	see_below			These are the variable measurements.  the original source data contains a combination of gyroscope and accelerometer information modified with filters and mathematical calculations.  The data processing includes averaging out all of the measurements.  So every recording of tBodyAcc_mean_X for the combinate of a specific subject and activity is averaged together for the output of this file.

there are 30 subjects and 6 activities.
30x6=180

So there are 180 records.
there are 79 data points per record.
So there are 14,220 data points (79x180)
